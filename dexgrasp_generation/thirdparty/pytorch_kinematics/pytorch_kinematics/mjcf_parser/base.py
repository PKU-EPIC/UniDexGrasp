    This class is provided so that `isinstance(foo, Element)` is `True` for all
    Element-like objects. We do not implement the actual element here because
    the actual object returned from traversing the object hierarchy is a
    weakproxy-like proxy to an actual element. This is because we do not allow
    orphaned non-root elements, so when a particular element is removed from the
    tree, all references held automatically become invalid.
